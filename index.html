      <p>In New York City, civilian allegations against the police are serious accusations, often reflecting potential police misconduct. These are processed by the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB), an independent agency separate from the NYPD since 1993.</p>

      </div>

      <p>An in-depth analysis of CCRB data shows over 370,000 allegations since 2000. These fall into four categories—Force, Abuse of Authority, Discourtesy, and Offensive Language (FADO). More than half involve abuse of authority.</p>

      <div id="treeMapContainer"></div>

      <p>While abuse of authority is most common, excessive or inappropriate use of force makes up 40% of all allegations. This suggests potential systemic issues with use-of-force policies.</p>

      <p>Other frequent issues include improper searches and arrests. Discrimination and the use of slurs or racial profiling also appear. Surprisingly, fewer than 150 allegations involve sexual misconduct—pointing to likely underreporting or undercounting.</p>

      </div>

      <p>The 75th precinct stands out for high allegation volume and a troubled past, including corruption scandals like those exposed by the 'Mollen Commission' and the documentary "The Seven Five." These trends suggest historical and social dynamics may fuel conflict between police and communities here.</p>

      <p>In summary, these 370,000+ allegations highlight the need for accountability, transparency, and reform. Data like this can inform better policies and help rebuild public trust in law enforcement.</p>
